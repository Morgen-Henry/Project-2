# Project 2: Gina Fender and Morgen Henry

In this project we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. Following this transformation, we created four CSV files and used them to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded these CSV files into a Postgres database.
