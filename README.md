# Project 2: Gina Fender and Morgen Henry

In this project we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. Following this transformation, we created four CSV files and used them to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded these CSV files into a Postgres database.

## Submitted files
* Resources (not including starter code)
    * `campaign.csv`: data from `crowdfunding.xlsl` transformed into "campaign" Dataframe and exported as csv file
    * `category.csv`: data from `crowdfunding.xlsl` transformed into "category" Dataframe and exported as csv file
    * `contacts.csv`: data from `crowdfunding.xlsl` transformed into "contacts" Dataframe and exported as csv file
    * `Crowdfunding_DB`: sql file to create campaign, category, contacts, and subcategory tables and view
    * `crowdfunding_db_schema`: ERD of Crowdfunding_DB tables
    * `subcategory.csv`: data from `crowdfunding.xlsl` transformed into "subcategory" Dataframe and exported as csv file

* `ETL_Mini_Project_GFender_MHenry.ipynb`: code to perform actions on starter code to produce files in Resources
